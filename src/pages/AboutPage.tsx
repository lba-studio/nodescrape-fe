      <p>
        The news is an integral part of our lives.
        We listen to news outlets in order to obtain the latest information regarding events which are occurring around us.
        In essence, watching the news would allow us to form a picture of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we've never considered how the news would make us feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one of the reasons why we've built News Neutrality Scraper.
