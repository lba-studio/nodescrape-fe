        <Typography>
          The news is an integral part of our lives. We listen to news outlets
          in order to obtain the latest information regarding events which are
          occurring around us. In essence, watching the news would allow us to
          form a picture of reality. For some of us, it is literally our virtual
          doorway to the outside world.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          However, we've never considered how the news would make us feel. With
          the ongoing battle to grab your attention, media outlets often opt to
          connect emotionally with you. Sensationalist news are everywhere;
          ranging from scathing coverage of royal weddings to glowing reviews of
          your country's immigration policy. Everyone aims to appeal to you and
          other readers like you.

        <Typography>
          <b>This is why we've built {siteTitle}.</b> We want to make sure that
          you have the tools to be aware of how the news could affect you
          mentally and emotionally.
