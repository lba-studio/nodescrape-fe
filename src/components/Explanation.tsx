            <li><b>Scores are from -1 to 1</b>, with -1 implying that all the text in that news source only contains sentimentally negative words, and 1 implying that the text only contains positive words.</li>
            <li>A scraper retrieves news articles from various sources (English-only, for now).</li>
            <li>Those news articles are then fed into our sentiment analysis pipeline.</li>
            <li>The text in those news articles are broken down into "tokens" (i.e. individual words).</li>
            <li>The words are run against a "lexicon" (specifically AFINN, for now; see roadmap); things that contain words and their properties (in this case, our sentiment polarity score).</li>
            <li>The scores of each tokens/words in the news articles are then averaged for their respective news sources.</li>
