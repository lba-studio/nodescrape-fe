          <Typography variant="h3">What do the scores mean?</Typography>
          <b>Each news source is given a score from -1 to 1.</b> These scores are obtained by doing an automated sentiment analysis on the source's most recent 100 text articles and averaging each articles' scores.
          <ul>
            <li>1 = implies that the news source contains only sentimentally positive articles. <i>For example: "I love ice creams because they are really delicious!"</i></li>
            <li>0 = implies that the news source contains only sentimentally neutral articles. <i>For example: "1 + 1 is 2."</i></li>
            <li>-1 = implies that the news source contains only sentimentally negative articles. <i>For example: "I really hate life. Go f*** yourself."</i></li>
          </ul>

          <Typography variant="h3">How do we come up with the score for a news source?</Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>A scraper retrieves news articles from various sources (English-only, for now).</li>
            <li>Those news articles are then fed into our sentiment analysis pipeline, which spits out this score.</li>
            <li>The scores of each tokens/words in the news articles are then averaged for their respective news sources.</li>
          </ul>
        </PageSection>
        <PageSection>
          <Typography variant="h3">Sentiment analysis pipeline? What's that?</Typography>
          <p>It sounds fancy, but it really isn't.</p>
          <p>We are currently using Amazon Comprehend, which is Amazon's natural language processing (NLP) service. In essence, it's sort of like the system that powers Amazon Echo/Google Home in the sense that it uses machine learning to understand what someone is trying to say.</p>
          <p>When feeding stuff into our "pipeline", we get a set of scores back from Amazon Comprehend, which indicates the level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has on whether or not a particular text is negative, positive or neutral. We then combine these scores based on the following formula [Score = Confidence of text being positive - Confidence of text being negative]</p> 
          <p>For more information, feel free to browse our GitHub to figure out how this score is calculated.</p>
        </PageSection>
        <PageSection>
          <Typography variant="h3">Wait, so can the score be biased?</Typography>
          <p>Of course! Sentiments are always subjective; it is literally to the eye of the beholden. Words mean differently in different contexts and cultures, so it is ultimately impossible to come up with an objective score.</p>
          <p>However, by using hosted services (such as Amazon Comprehend), we hope to leverage the immense dataset that they have, which should yield a more accurate, less-biased result.</p>
